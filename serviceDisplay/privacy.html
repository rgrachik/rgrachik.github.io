Privacy Policy for Service Interval Display

Last Updated: 04.12.2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Service Interval Display application ("the App") handles your information.

1. Core Principle: Minimal Data Collection

The Service Interval Display app is designed with respect for your privacy. We DO NOT collect, analyze, or share your personal data with third parties for our own purposes. This means we do not have access to your service history, vehicle details, or any other information you enter into the App.

2. Data Storage and Synchronization via iCloud

To provide the key feature of syncing your data across your Apple devices, the App uses the iCloud service.

What is Synced: Only the data you create within the App is saved to your private iCloud container: service records, vehicle information, set intervals, and preferences.

Control and Access: This data is stored in your personal iCloud account and protected by Apple's security. We, as the developers, do not have the technical or administrative ability to access the content of this data. You manage it (including deletion) through your Apple device settings.

Purpose: Synchronization is solely for your convenience and to enable the App to work across multiple devices you own.

3. No Third-Party Analytics or Advertising

The App does not use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics or Firebase Analytics) and does not contain advertising modules that could collect usage data.

4. Permissions

The App may request device permissions (e.g., for sending notifications) to provide its core functionality. These permissions are used only locally on your device.

5. Security

The security of your data stored locally and in iCloud depends on the security of your device and the protective mechanisms provided by Apple. We recommend using a strong device passcode and enabling two-factor authentication for your Apple ID.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App. Your continued use of the App after any modification constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
